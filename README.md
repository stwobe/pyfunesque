This is a fun Python timer app - with sounds from your machine!!! 

You will need:

Bash
Linux
Python3
Libre Office

If you haven't got Libre Office installed, you'll have to change the code so that it points to some other sounds in your machine - try locate *.wav to find some other WAVs.

The default is 10 minutes - enou0gh time to heat that water up for those peas..
(600 seconds)

Then, after the counter has counted down, you should hear the train sounds. They will not stop until you kill the program..
